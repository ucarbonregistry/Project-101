5 MW Nand Solar Power Project By M/S K.K.Kashyap Green Solar Energy Producer in Himachal Pradesh
This is a single project activity of capacity 5 MWp, which is grid connected solar PV power generation 
project in the District Solan, in the state of Himachal Pradesh, in India. As per the ex-ante estimate, 
this project will generate approximately 8,760 MWh of electricity per annum considering an average PLF of 20%. 
The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is expected to be 7,884 tCO2e/year.


The project activity involves Ground Mounted Photovoltaic (PV) Plant having aggregated installed
capacity of 5000 kW. The project activity uses Polycrystalline solar photovoltaic technology to 
generate clean energy. Solar radiation is converted directly into electricity by solar cells (photovoltaic 
cells). In such cells, a small electric voltage is generated when light strikes the junction between a 
metal and a semiconductor (such as silicon) or the junction between two different semiconductors. 
Photovoltaic module consists of several photovoltaic cells connected by circuits and sealed in an 
environmentally protective laminate, which forms the fundamental building blocks of the complete 
PV generating unit. Several PV panels mounted on a frame are termed as PV Array.
